site_generate
=============

Contains all the python files to generate the static(HTML, CSS, etc.) files.


This repo contains all the necessary files needed to generate the static output files.

You need to have Pelican (as well as Markdown) installed on your system to make this work. Best current way to do this is using venv (some *nix libraries required in python installation too).

Link to setup Pelican found here: 

http://chdoig.github.io/create-pelican-blog.html

OR  here:

When output is generated, make sure that you copy it from "output" folder into the gautengpug.github.io folder/repo. Only output must exist in that repo.
