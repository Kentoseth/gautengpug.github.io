This will be our final meetup for 2014.

Due to this being the final meetup and also a celebration of us hitting the 100 member milestone in a few short months, the program is slightly longer.

The talk/s will be short, and are meant to be conversation starters. Should you not be available for the entire meetup, you are welcome to come say hi and leave early.

The following talks/activities will be presented/happening:

•  Tour of JoziHub/44 on Stanley (Sam Manclark)

• Rapid Intro to Flask (Adam)

• General Intro to Nim (Hussain)

• #Interesting talk 3 (members encouraged to get in touch with organizers if you'd like to present anything)

• Lunch break (if anyone wants to)


Other(meta) activities:

• Product demos (Great place to kick-start your startup/side-project, so share your project with us)

• Troubleshooting (think of it as a "live" version of StackOverflow)

• Networking/ideas/open-source/startups/python-careers

[JoziHub](http://jozihub.co.za) is located at
[44 Stanley Ave in Millpark](http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/162961866#map=18/-26.18514/28.01931).
