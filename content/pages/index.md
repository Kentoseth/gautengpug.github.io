## >>>>  NEXT MEETUP - [28 June 2014]({filename}/june2014_meetup.md)



## Welcome to the Gauteng Python User Group

We are a diverse group of (aspiring) Pythonistas from South Africa's Gauteng
province. We host monthly [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Gauteng-Python-Users-Group/),
mostly on Saturdays, where we connect with each other and discuss anything
Python related.

Besides our monthly meetups, most discussions happen in the
[GPUG Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gpugsa).

All Pythonistas are welcome to join us.
