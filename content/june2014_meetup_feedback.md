Summary: Feedback on the June meetup.

The meetup was hosted at [JoziHub](http://jozihub.co.za) on 28 June 2014,
09:00. There was a total of 7 attendees, of which 3 were newcomers.

## Discussions

We started off with informal introductions and a discussion on the purpose of
GPUG. This discussion was continued on our
[forums](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/gpugsa/siOAqwrp-7M). During the rest
of these discussions, it came to light that all of our newcomers learned of the
meetup via our [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Gauteng-Python-Users-Group/)
page and were unaware of this site and our Google Group. It is clear that we
need to increase the visibility of these other resources.

Frank was scheduled to present a talk on his accounting software, but a power
outage prevented him from doing so. In stead, he shared his experience with
Python 3.4's `asyncio` module and subsequently did a
[writeup]({filename}/asyncio.md) on the topic.

Walter presented an introduction to MongoDB, `pymongo` and MongoEngine. The
IPython notebook and slides were committed to our
[talks repository](https://github.com/gautengpug/talks/tree/master/2014/june_meetup/pymongo_intro).

## Conclusion

Based on the pursuant discussions, Corrie's experience with PL/Python in
PostgreSQL and Iwan's testing experience was identified as valuable topics for
future talks.

The meetup adjourned at about 12:30. Thanks to all attendees, and to JoziHub
for providing the venue.
